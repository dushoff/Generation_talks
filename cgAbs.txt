Transmission intervals and COVID control

The spread of epidemics is structured by delay distributions,
including the now-famous “serial interval” between the symptom-onset
times of an infector and an infectee (often conflated with the
“generation interval” between infection times). Defining these time
distributions clearly, and describing how they relate to each other,
and to key parameters of disease spread, poses interesting theoretical
and practical questions, some of which are still open.

I will discuss how transmission intervals link the “speed” and
“strength” of epidemics, issues in their estimation, and their role in
helping monitor changes in the parameters underlying the spread of
COVID-19 disease.

The spread of epidemics is structured by time distributions,
including the now-famous “serial interval” between when an individual experiences symptoms, and when the person that they infect experiences symptoms. This is often used to represent the “generation interval” between when the same two individuals were infected, but these can be importantly different. Defining these time distributions clearly, and describing how they relate to each other, and to key parameters of disease spread, poses interesting theoretical and practical questions.

I will discuss how transmission intervals link the “speed” and “strength” of epidemics, issues in their estimation, and their role in helping monitor changes in the parameters underlying disease, with examples from COVID-19, rabies and other HIV.
