The serial-mean paradox

	Serial intervals measure generations of the same process as generation
	intervals

		Should have the same mean

		But often larger variance (flu example)

	Empirically, even the means are not the same!

	Generation interval:

		Latent + infectious waiting â€¦ of infector

	Serial interval:

		Symptomatic waiting (infector) + Incubation (infectee)

Heterogeneity

BC

CFIG rabies_correlations/intervalPlots.Rout.pdf

NC

	Generation intervals include latent period of infectors only (often strongly
	weighted)

	Serial intervals average over infectees (everyone is infected once)

	Coronavirus: people diagnosed early are less likely to transmit

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The link paradox

	Imagine a renewal process where symptoms in the infector cause symptoms in
	the infectee

		Assume homogeneity

	This has to match the same \rR\ link as the true process

	But it also can't (because the serial interval is in general broader than
	the generation interval)

		All else equal, a broader interval means lower \Rx.

The forward serial interval

	Dynamical effects mean that the forward serial interval is shortened!
